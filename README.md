# Hello There <img src="images/hi.gif" alt="drawing" width="24"/>

My name is David, a aspiring web developer from the UK. I have a passion for learning new technologies and designing and building things with those technologies. I have a sharp eye for detail and always try and push myself that little bit further.

In my down time you'll find me chilling watching football, listening to music or cooking and eating spicy foods :hot_pepper:

- ðŸŒ± I hope to start learning and using more technologies like wordpress and php in the future!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my react skills by building a lot off different projects with it.
- ðŸ“« If your interested in working together, get in touch here!
