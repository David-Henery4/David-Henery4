# Hello There <img src="images/hi.gif" alt="drawing" width="24"/>

## **A little bit about myself**

Hi, my name is David a aspiring web developer from the UK. I have a passion for learning new technologies and designing and building things with those technologies. I have a sharp eye for detail and always try and push myself that little bit further.

In my down time you'll find me chilling watching football, listening to music or cooking and eating spicy foods :hot_pepper:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and hope to start building my own projects with it soon!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on trying to teach my spanish in my spare time :🇪🇸:
